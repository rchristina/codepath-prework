## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Something I had trouble with was finding time to work on the submission due to the fact I chose to start on it during midterm season. I underestimated how much time it would take to work on it, especially because there were a lot of informative resources I enjoyed looking through. I was able to work on it little by little all while learning new things along the way. I took note of the times I started and stopped so that I could calculate the total by the end. When I added up my times, I was surprised to see it was only about 2 hours of work. I see now that it is something that could’ve been done in one sitting for some, but I do not regret splitting up my time because I was also able to prepare for my midterms and concentrate on other coursework. I was worried I would get overwhelmed, but managing my time really saved me.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Something I wonder is about the design process, specifically of the UI. I would like to know if web developers ever get to design the UI, or if they are mostly just told what to create and they do so. How much say does a developer get in the design? Does it vary from workplace to workplace?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would have liked to make it so that each game produces a random set of sequences. This way, it plays like an actual game where the user can play multiple times and will have a new sequence each time. I would have also like to change the pitches of the buttons, especially because I am unfamiliar with the sound portion of this code, I would have liked to play around with it.
